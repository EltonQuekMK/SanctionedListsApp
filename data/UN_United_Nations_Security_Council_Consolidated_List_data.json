Under Malong’s leadership, the SPLA attacked civilians, schools and hospitals; forced the displacement of civilians; carried out enforced disappearances; arbitrarily detained civilians; and conducted acts of torture, and rape. He mobilized the Mathiang Anyoor Dinka tribal militia, which uses child soldiers.

On 6 February 2019, 3R signed the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR but has engaged in acts violating the Agreement and remains a threat to the peace, stability and security of the CAR. For instance, on 21 May 2019, 3R killed 34 unarmed civilians in three villages, summarily executing adult males. Bi Sidi Souleman openly confirmed to a UN Entity that he had ordered 3R elements to the villages on the date of the attacks, but did not admit to giving the orders for 3R to kill.  In December 2020, after having joined a coalition of armed groups established to disrupt the electoral process, Bi Sidi Souleman was reportedly killed during fighting.
